# Hello Universe

> A work is never completed except by some accident such as weariness, satisfaction, the need to deliver, or death: for, in relation to who or what is making it, it can only be one stage in a series of inner transformations. - Paul Valery

This nicely encapsulates the artist's struggle, in that there is always more than can be done, refined, rethought, iterated upon. An endless move towards an unachievable state of perfection of the artifact.

While maybe not obvious to the outside oberserver, this also applies to software development. While the end result of software is often defined by strict requirements, it is the creative process as to how these requirements are met that is in the hands of the developer, as an artist.

Code can always be neater, more concise, clearer, more performant, more elegant. Systems can be simplified. Teams can operate more effectively and deliver more value, more often.

Beyond software, sacred cows should be questioned, dogma should be avoided, and decisions made by the demonstrable merit of the proposal. Pursue continuous improvement by responding to change and responding when presented with new information.

The universe is chaos, and everything is a draft. 1
