On the 22nd of September, 2022, Optus *customers* were the victims of a massive data breach. Optus are storing PII (Personally Identifiable Information) from customers within the past 6 years, and an attacker was able to access millions of these records.

## What we know

- Telecommunication companies are required to retain certain data by the Federal Government as per [data retention obligations](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/national-security/lawful-access-telecommunications/data-retention-obligations)
- Optus met this requirement, and as such, had customer's PII data stored in their systems
- Optus is is facing a US$1 million extortion demand to prevent the sale of what an attacker says are up to 11.2 million sensitive customer records
- If you've used Optus, or one of their subsidiaries, in the past 6 years, you may be affected
- Stolen data includes customer's email address, full name, date-of-birth, mobile number, drivers licence and passport numbers
- Optus has notified the affected customers of which of their details they are storing and were compromised

## Why you should be outraged

No matter how they spin it, Optus was not the victim here. Their customers were, and Optus has broken that trust through poor data stewardship. PII data is incredibly sensitive, as in Australia it constitutes *100 points of ID and can be used to fraudulently access credit*, ruining the victim's credit rating and financial life. Beyond this, it also exposes the victim to identity crime and scams. This type of data should be stored with great consideration and guarded with the highest controls. Optus has demonstrated they did neither of these things. 

## What to do next

1. Use a different telecommunication provider than Optus. While this type of breach *could* happen to any of them, Optus has demonstrated they don't respect your data and privacy, and should not be rewarded for it.
2. Subscribe to a credit rating provider (not [Equifax](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3444488/equifax-data-breach-faq-what-happened-who-was-affected-what-was-the-impact.html)) to monitor your credit access and identify attempts to catch anyone using your details. Credit rating providers can also put a hold on your rating for 21 days to prevent anyone immediately using your details.
3. If affected, consider changing your details where available, i.e. new drivers licence, email address, phone number.
4. Express your displeasure at this absolute disgrace to the federal minister responsible at [https://minister.infrastructure.gov.au/rowland/contact](https://minister.infrastructure.gov.au/rowland/contact) and make a formal complaint with Optus at [https://www.optus.com.au/support/contact-us](https://www.optus.com.au/support/contact-us)

## General security precautions

- Use a password manager like [1Password](https://1password.com/) to ensure all services use a unique, long and complex password.
- Use an app-based (not SMS) 2FA (multi-factor authentication) solution to ensure you approve access to systems like your bank account. I recommend [Authy](https://authy.com/).
- Create a new email address and set it up as recovery email address and only use this second email address in case you get locked out of your primary email account.
- Use the site [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see if your emails or phone numbers have been identified as part of a data breach.

## Updates

As this is still an unfolding situation, there are some updates:

- State governments are requesting Optus cover the cost of a drivers licence replacement fee for those affected
- Due to COVID-19 delays, replacing passports may take more than three months
- The attacker has now apologised rescinded their demand, claimed to have deleted the data and no further records will be released beyond the initial 10000
